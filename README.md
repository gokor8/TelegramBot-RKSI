This project was made for my college and for college competitions
Its functional is fully working, and multithreaded.

Its includes:
* Send Shedule in 2 types
* Save your often group.
* Send everyday schedule for tomorrow
* It also works with the message keyboard and the user keyboard
* And other more functional

In this project i tried to build the right architecture, correctly use OOP and olso use principles of SOLID.
I hope all isnt so bad turned out
